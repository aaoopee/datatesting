    "Your task is to build logistic regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models for solving tissue type prediction task. During this course, you have familiarized yourself with multiple ML methods from scikit-learn library, but now you will need to independently learn the specifics of how to use the SVM classifier in scikit-learn by studying the documentation and related resources. \n",
    "    \n",
    "More precisely, you need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Upload the \"data_subset.csv\" file as a Pandas dataframe. The file contains gene expression data for tissues of different types. The first column contains the sample id and the second column indicates how the data was analysed (Robust Multi-array Average or RMA). The remaining columns, excluding the final one, contain the relative gene expression values. Finally, the last column contains the category (label) to which the data points belong to ('cell line', 'disease', 'neoplasm', 'normal'). \n",
